    "###  Activity 2.0: Loop Ordering and False Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity reinforces the concept of reduction and the caching principles taught in the lecture on Cilk on Sep. 18. It is recommended that you run this on the CS machines `gradx.cs.jhu.edu` or `ugradx.cs.jhu.edu`.  The results make sense here.  It is OK to run this on any machine that has at least 4 cores.  If you run on different machine, you may end up with slightly different results. It is OK if your results don't track exactly with the expected findings. On my M1 laptop the results get confusing.\n",

    "\n",
    "The is a nested loop program that counts the number of occurences of a list of tokens in an array of elements. This is a common computing pattern in data analytics. This could be used to count the number of messages sent in a network from a set of sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two serial versions of the program.  These are:\n",
    "  * `countTokensElementsFirst`: loop over the larger elements array in the outer loop and the smaller tokens array in the inner loop.\n",

    "1. It is more efficient to iterate over the tokens in the inner loop since the array of tokens is much smaller than the the array of elements. If we iterate over the elements in the inner loop, we will incur several cache misses when iterating over the large array of elements, which will then be repeated for each iteration of the outer loop. If there are $n$ cache misses when iterating sequentially over the elements array and $k$ tokens, we will encounter $nk$ cache misses from this loop order. On the other hand, if we iterate over the tokens in the inner loop, the cache misses from iterating over the large elements array will only happen once since it is in the outer loop resulting only, in $n$ cache mises from the elements array.\n",
    "2. ->\n",
    "    1. The function omp_countTokensElementsFirst performs unsafe sharing in the tokens array. Since we parallelized the outer for loop, this function assigns different elements of the elements array to different threads. However, different elements of the elements array may match the same token. Thus, we would have different threads attempting to increment the same variable in memory in the tokens array, creating a race condition. \n",
    "    2. The function omp_countTokensTokensFirst assigns different elements of the token array to different threads since the outer loop iterates over the tokens. Since that is the loop we parallelize, each thread will get assigned a different iteration of the loop which corresponds to a different token.\n",
    "3. Each thread will be updating their own tokens variable wihin the tokens array. However, since the tokens array is small, the memory location each thread is accessing within the tokens array will likely lie on the same memory line. As a result, every time one thread updates their local token variable, the entire memory line will be marked as dirty. When another thread tries to update or read their local token variable, it has to update its own cache since the first thread modified the line of memory. This pattern where each thread has their own local variable but all of them are on one memory line resulting in performance loss due to the line of memory constantly being dirty from the operations of other threads is false sharing.\n",
    "4. The unrolled loop is more efficient as it does 8 loop calculations of the original loop in one loop of the unrolled loop. This means the unrolled loop has 1/8th the amount of conditional checks and branching instructions that must be performed at the start of every loop."
